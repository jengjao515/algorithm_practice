# Algorithm Practice
This repository holds some practice algorithms from Codility. 

_Codility_ lets you try the same problem in a variety of languages with a time limit of 2 hours. After you submit your answer, the code is run through different test cases. The results page shows Big O Notation and the tests it failed so the coder can try and optimize their piece of code.
